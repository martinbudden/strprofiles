strprofiles
===========

This is a small project with various utilities to support calculations on DNA profiles and STR allele frequency data. In particular:

* reading of allele frequency data from a .csv file
* calculation of DNA profile random match probabilities, including adjustments for low allele frequencies and population subdivisions (populations not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).
