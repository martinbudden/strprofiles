The test suite is located in the test directory.

The tests may be run with py.test[1]. If you have py.test
installed, from the TiddlyWeb base directory simply type

  py.test

and the tests will be found and run. If there are failures
the output can be a bit hard to interpret. You can run
an individual test file, with more verbose output as follows:

  py.test -v --nocapture test/test_web_tiddler.py

You can run the tests to the first failure:

  py.test -svx

This helps quite a bit with dealing with the error
output.
